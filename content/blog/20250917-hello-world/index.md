Hi, I’m starting my blog using Zola and the Duckquill theme. This post is just a quick “hello” and a smoke test that everything is wired correctly.

<!-- more -->

### Why Zola + Duckquill?

- Zola is fast, simple, and uses Tera templates.
- Duckquill is clean, lightweight, and has nice defaults (including dark mode and cards) — see the theme site for features and options: [Duckquill docs](https://duckquill.daudix.one/).

### What’s next

- Configure site metadata
- Write more posts and add tags.
- Optional: add a banner image to this post

Thanks for reading!
