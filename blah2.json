To me, this means that what we want is built through consistency, consistent daily actions. The choices we make, whether to show up or not or to stay disciplined and do the hard things, add up and ultimately shape the person that we are or want to become. So it's not so much about luck or the perfect opportunity. It's more so about creating the lifestyle you want through your daily habits. That's really what I took away from Aristotle's quote.
